# Executive Project Summary
  
### Problem Statement  
Every year consumers spend hundreds, if not thousands of dollars buying new clothes. We spend a fortune on top of the line washers, dryers, laundry detergents, fabric softener, bleach, and stain removers. It would be safe to say that the average person cares quite a bit about how they dress themselves and how well their clothing is maintained. However, within this cycle of caring for clothing, a common issue has affected almost anyone who washes their own clothes. During the drying process, a brand-new or even an old beloved article of clothing has shrunk. That article of clothing spent too much time in the dryer and it is now ruined forever. However, this could have been avoided if the individual had used FlyDry. 

### Project Goals  
The task to end laundry skrinkage is by no means small, however it is an achievable goal. The following is a list of projects goals that will be achieved in order to make FlyDry a successful reality. 
 1. Perform intense laundry analytics. Studying average laundry dry time will be done on the following categories of laundry loads. 
    
    a. Colors, Darks, Whites, Small-Loads, Medium-Loads, and Large-Loads
 2. Create a protective environment for the FlyDry device to prevent it from being harmed in the dryer. 
 3. Create an application with a easy-to-use user interface which allows the consumer to quickly and easily choose their laundry load of choice.
 4. Ensure that the FlyDry device works accurately with the application.
 5. Perform penetration testing to ensure the application is safe from malicious entities.
 
### Project Merit
FlyDry is a new technology designed to help consumers save their clothing. With the utilization of IoT and temperature sensing technology, FlyDry determines how long laundry needs to stay in the drier before it risks overheating, causing clothes to shink. This device will save the average consumer from ruining their own clothes. Since this is a common issue that happens to almost everyone, this product can be marketed to the masses. Anyone between the ages of 16-100 will have an interest in this product.
